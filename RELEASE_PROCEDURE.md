# Release Procedure

The release procedure is a process in which different parts of the repository are involved.<br>
These symbols help with orientation:
* 🐙 GitHub
* 💠 git (Bash)
* 📝 File
* 💻 Command Line (CMD)


## Version Numbers

This software follows the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).<br>
It always has the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, e.g. `1.5.0`.


## GitHub Release

Following the Semantic Versioning, different workflows for Major, Minor, or Patch
releases are possible. <br>
For Major and Minor releases, follow the complete workflow.<br>
For a **Patch Release** (Hotfix), start at [section 3](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/production/RELEASE_PROCEDURE.md#4--create-a-draft-github-release).

## PyPi Release

### 0. 💻 Check release on Test-PyPI
* Check if the release it correctly displayed on [Test-PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/open-mastr/#history)
* With each push to the release branch or the branch `test-release` the package is released on [Test-PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/open-mastr/#history) by GitHub workflow (test-pypi-publish.yml).
  * Note: Pre-releases on Test-PyPI are only shown under `Release history` in the navigation bar.
  * Note: The branch status can only be released to a version on Test-PyPI once. Thus, for every branch status that you want to see on Test-PyPI increment the build version with `bump2version build` and push afterward.
* Once testing on Test-PyPI is done, change the release version to the final desired version with `bump2version release`
  * Note: The release on Test-PyPI might fail, but it will be the correct release version for the PyPI server.
* Push commits to the `release-*` branch

### 1. 💻 Create and publish package on PyPI
* Navigate to git folder `cd D:\git\github\GROUP\REPO\`
* Create package using `python setup.py sdist`
* Check that file has been created in folder `dist`
* Activate python environment `activate release_py38`
* Upload to PyPI using `twine upload dist/NAME_0.5.1.tar.gz`
* Enter `name` and `password`
* Check on PyPI if release arrived
* Breath three times and smile

▶️ Publish the Package

### 🐙 GitHub workflows for automated release

* The automation workflow will build and upload the PyPi Package.
  * Note: Each package version (as specified in the [setup.py](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/master/setup.py#L13)) can only be released once.

* [Test Workflows](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/actions/workflows/test-pypi-publish.yml): Update the PyPi Test Package [oemetadata pypi test](https://test.pypi.org/project/oemetadata/)
  * Note: The Test Workflows are triggered when pushing to the branch `deployment-test`.

* [Release Deployment Workflow](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/actions/workflows/pypi-publish.yml): Updates the PyPi Package [oemetadata](https://pypi.org/project/oemetadata/)
  * Note: The Release Deployment Workflow is triggered by the GitHub release.
