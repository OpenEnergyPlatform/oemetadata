# Metadata Documentation

Open Energy Metadata (OEMetadata) is a metadata standard for the energy domain. <br>
It is an extensive set of metadata based on the [Data Package Standard 2.0](https://datapackage.org/) and [DCAT-AP 3.0](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#Distribution) specifications. <br>
It is made to facilitate findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) of data. <br>
A badge system prioritises the keys and serves as a measure of the completeness and quality of the metadata entries.

The metadata contains keys in a nested JSON structure.<br>
The metadata standard includes the following files

- [`schema.json`](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/production/metadata/latest/schema.json) contains the complete schema.
- [`metadata_key_description.md`](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/production/metadata/latest/metadata_key_description.md) contains a full description of each metadata key.
- [`template.json`](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/production/metadata/latest/template.json) contains an empty metadata string with all fields.
- [`example.json`](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/production/metadata/latest/example.json) contains a basic metadata example.
