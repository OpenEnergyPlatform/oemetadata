# Metadata Documentation

Open Energy Metadata (OEMetadata) is a metadata standard for the energy domain. <br>
It is an extensive set of metadata based on the [Data Package Standard 2.0](https://datapackage.org/) and [DCAT-AP 3.0](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#Distribution) specifications. <br>
It is made to facilitate findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) of data. <br>
A badge system prioritises the keys and serves as a measure of the completeness and quality of the metadata entries.

The metadata contains multiple fields (keys) in a nested JSON structure.
- `metadata_key_description.md` contains a full description of each metadata key.
- `template.json` contains an empty metadata string with all fields.
- `example.json` contains a basic metadata example.
